&nbsp; (1).The first step to warp an image into spherical coordinate
works well and I apply radial distortion to this part. The coefficient
of the k1 and k2 is derived from calibration toolkit supported by <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Simsun; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Jean-Yves Bouguet</span>.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 240px; height: 211px;" alt="checkBox" src="images/1.jpg"><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="extrinsic" style="width: 238px; height: 208px;"><img style="width: 240px; height: 209px;" alt="extrinsic_2" src="images/3.jpg"><img style="width: 241px; height: 210px;" alt="error_analyse" src="images/4.jpg"><img style="width: 789px; height: 406px;" alt="calibration" src="images/5.jpg"><img style="width: 330px; height: 403px;" alt="warp_image" src="images/6.jpg"><br></div>&nbsp;
&nbsp; (2).About the features detection and feature descriptor, I
didm't use my own one but use the sift.The program is provided by lowe.
But the ratio match is finished by my self and works well.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (3).The ransac also works well, I get almost exact result after I running it on the test_set.<br>&nbsp;
&nbsp; (4).So once the ransan is good, the neighborhood translations is
also good. The picture below showing the comparison between my
calculation result and the example result. (pairlist.txt is my own one)<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 713px; height: 293px;" alt="comparison_ransac" src="images/7.jpg"><br></div>&nbsp;
&nbsp; (5).I choose to correct every single col by using the ratio =
(total drift)*(x of col)/(total x direction length),and It works well,
but there is still the possiblity that the good result comes from the
using of tripod, so there is not too severe drift in y direction. The
picture below showing the comparison between my result and example
result on yosemite.The drift has been well handled. <br><img style="width: 1590px; height: 212px;" alt="drift" src="images/16.jpg"><br><img style="width: 1588px; height: 212px;" alt="no drift" src="images/15.jpg"><br>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beside the drift, the second question is the
left trim, Because we are doing an panorama, so we often retake the
first picture again, So in order to prevent the same object from
appearing in the same panorama , we trim the left edge and subtract the
total width by one image's width. But, in some panorama, it's not
acutually a panorama, which is 360. like the picture below, it's
clearly not 360 picture, so we don't need to trim it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So,my algorithm keep the total width and seamlessly combine all the 4 images of yosemite.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 854px; height: 251px;" alt="self_yosemite" src="images/8.jpg"><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 541px; height: 280px;" alt="example_yosemite" src="images/9.jpg"><br></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (6).I used two way of blending. or should not use blending.<br>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The First one is the x direction feathering
and it did works very good but there exists the problem of ghosting and
can not handle the exposure problem.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; The second way is the image cut and blend. The algorithm will
choose which part to use instead of blending all of them and also to
feathering blend in the seam of each image pair.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The result will be showed in the second part(extra credit 1~2)<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 851px; height: 431px;" alt="cut and blend" src="images/17.jpg"><br><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is how I did my blend and cut job,
the red color means the pixel for the left most image, blue for middle
one, green for right most one.The yellow area means blend using
feathering.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I simply use the
former image's pixel information and when reach the boundary, I use the
feathering method to blend. so the result will be better.</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;"><big style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big>2.Extra Credit</big></big></big><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.de-ghost.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.same person in different picture.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.graph cut<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1473px; height: 395px;" alt="x direction feathering" src="images/10.jpg"><br><img style="width: 1475px; height: 396px;" alt="cut but also blend" src="images/11.jpg"><br><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;
&nbsp; My classmate Wu lei ran across each shot when I took the image
for panorama, So this set of images make me finsh the de-ghost and one
person in each camera three parts in once.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; We can see
from the upper picture which applied the x direction feathring. So we
can see the person like a ghost appeared in each picture and being
transparent .This happened because the moving object walk across each
picture, object A do not appear in the same blend area, so, after
feathering, the object A will have weight less than 1 so appeared like
transparent .<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The detail of implement has been discussed in the (6) in part 1 summary.<br>&nbsp;
&nbsp; The best solution is to use cut but not blend, decide to use
which part of image instead of blending them all. But the result is
also bad when it comes to the edge,I mean it can not achieve
"seamless", So I made feathering blend on a relatively narrow area
around the seam of each image pair.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.apply raidal distortion<br><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I apply the radial distortion within the
warpSpherical.cpp, the coefficients come from the calibration using
check box. I took 24 checkbox picture from different angle and
calibrate the camera to derive the exact parameter for focal length and
k1 k2.<br><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img style="width: 690px; height: 607px;" alt="checkbox" src="images/14.jpg"></div></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" alt="image without distortion" src="images/12.jpg"><img style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" alt="image with radial distortion" src="images/13.jpg"><br>&nbsp;
